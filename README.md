# Welcome to my very first website [Sparrow's Nest](https://maya-claveau.github.io/PP1-Sparrows-Nest/)

This website is for a holiday accommodation based in Larnaca Cyprus, intend for people who love travelling either for leisure or work, or for no special reason at all, you just want to be on this beautiful island. It is aiming to provide,

- information about this accommodation including size, facilities and furnitures
- communication channel of being able to send request or any message to the owner
- phone number that people can call
- direction to the user, to make the journey smooth
- better idea of how it looks inside with lots of pictures

## Why This

The reason I chose to build this website is because Sparrow’s Nest belongs to my best friends, and this place holds a special place in my heart. In May 2018, we were facing one of the most difficult moments of our life as a family, and this place was offered to us for an unlimited time, for free. Calling it our safe boat is understatement. In fact, we had created countless happy moments together with my best friend's family. We bonded after 10 years of being apart. Our kids also became very close. My son was 6 at the time, enjoyed the adventures we embarked together. He is calling them “my old best friends” to this day. This project is dedicated to my lifelong friends(in no preferential order), David, Elina, Jada and Daniel.

## Features

## Tools used: 

google fonts(link) for selecting the fonts for the project, which in my opinion look nice together, and most importantly it is easy to read. 

Font color(link):
I used colorspace to pick the color palettes, see screenshot

## Things I tried but didn't work

As for the main image, what I wanted to do involved JavaScript (see screenshot wireframe), so I changed to a more simple layout for this project.
